% This file explains the input format used to describe systems.
% Any file starting with a '%' is a comment and will be ignored.
% The first line of the file contains the name of the protocol
Example protocol
%
% After the first line, automatons are inputted
% The first line of an automaton contains its name
Example Automaton 1
%
% The other lines represent the transitions, start-state and end-states
%
% This defines A as the start-state. Only one start-state is allowed
> A
%
% This creates a Nop-transition to B
A > B
%
% This creates a Send-transition sending 'y' over channel 'x'
B x!y> A
%
% This creates a Receive-transition receiving 'z' from channel 'x'
B x?z> C
%
% This defines C as the end-state. Multiple end states are allowed
C >
%
% Automatons are separated by a comma
,
Example Automaton 2
> A
A x?y> B
B > C
B x!y> D
C > D
D x!z> E
E > B
% This automaton does not specify an end state. That means all states are considered end states
% Note that messages and states are not explicitly defined.
